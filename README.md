### SQL database writen in Scala

This is a SQL db project inspired by the following resource, https://cstack.github.io/db_tutorial/ as well as this tweet/X https://x.com/0xkatzz/status/1886672627118535070?t=TeGSmNWe8yCLWg-rLFH8RA&s=19 . I wanted to learn more about SQL as well as creating
a portfolio while also learn deeper about Scala language.

I am expecting to learn the following concepts/knowledge:
    1. API by creating an interface for my database to communicate with outside applications
    2. Parsing
    3. Data Structures and Algorithm by implementing B-Tree in Scala
    4. OS call within scala/jvm
    5. Unit Test
    6. Multi-threading (possibly)
    7. HTTPS API

This might still be early but if it works, I would like to create a db to combine redis, vector processing (with GPU).
